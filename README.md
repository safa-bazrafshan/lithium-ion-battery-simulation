# Lithium-Ion Battery Simulation using Simulink

This project presents a simulation of a Lithium-Ion Battery using MATLAB Simulink. It models the battery's electrical behavior and is useful in analyzing charge/discharge cycles, voltage response, and system integration with renewable energy or electric vehicles.

## Features
- Simulink-based simulation of a Li-ion battery cell
- Dynamic modeling of voltage vs. time
- Visualization of charge and discharge characteristics
- Suitable for control and energy management applications

## Files
- Lithium_Ion_Battery_Simulation.pdf — Full report and results
- .slx file (if included) — Simulink model of the battery system

## Preview
Screenshots or diagrams related to the battery simulation can be included here.
